The term Linux often gets used in different contexts, but at its core, Linux refers to the kernelâ€”the central part of an operating system responsible for managing hardware and system processes. The kernel is what runs behind the scenes, ensuring that your computer or device functions smoothly by controlling interactions between the hardware and the software.

Linux vs. GNU/Linux
When most people talk about Linux, they're actually referring to a combination of software called GNU/Linux. This includes:

GNU: A collection of free, open-source software that provides the core tools (like command-line utilities) needed to interact with a computer.
Linux: The kernel, which is the core that manages all the hardware resources.
So, when you hear "Linux" as an operating system, it's typically this combination of GNU tools and the Linux kernel that makes up a complete system.

A Brief History of UNIX and Linux
The story of Linux starts with UNIX, an operating system developed in the 1970s by AT&T Bell Labs. UNIX became popular due to its portability (it was written in the C programming language) and its modular design, which made it easy to adapt and extend. UNIX led to many variations, but only systems certified by the Open Group can officially be called "UNIX."

Linux itself began in 1991, created by Linus Torvalds as a personal project while studying at the University of Helsinki. Linus wanted to create a free and open-source alternative to MINIX, a UNIX-like system designed for educational purposes. From these modest beginnings, Linux evolved into the dominant operating system for servers and the backbone of the Internet. Despite its UNIX-like design, Linux isn't officially certified as UNIX.

The Role of the GNU Project
Parallel to Linux's development was the GNU Project, launched by Richard Stallman in 1983. GNU aimed to build a free operating system, but it became better known for creating essential tools (editors, compilers, etc.) that complement a kernel like Linux. As a result, the combination of Linux and GNU tools made a full operating system possible, and the tools we use today in Linux stem from these early GNU contributions.

Summary
In short, Linux is the kernel, the core of a system, while GNU/Linux refers to the complete operating system. Together, they power everything from servers to smartphones, and the entire open-source software movement owes a lot to these foundational projects. Despite its UNIX roots, Linux is not certified as UNIX but remains a crucial player in modern computing, thanks to its flexibility, community support, and open-source nature.
