The course provides multiple interactive features designed to enhance learning. It includes:

Navigation Tabs: Each chapter contains tabs for Content (reading material), Objectives (exam alignment and key knowledge areas), and Key Terms (definitions and links).
Table of Contents: Lists chapter pages and allows navigation between them.
Virtual Terminal: A command line interface (CLI) for hands-on practice, where users can apply concepts like logging in as a root user.
Reset Button: Resets the virtual environment to its original state, removing any changes made.
Examples: Command examples and concepts are embedded in the course, simulating terminal output.
Help Menu: Provides access to FAQs and a feedback option.
Additionally, Labs offer hands-on exercises after each chapter, allowing users to practice with a live Linux terminal. Some chapters may not have labs, and the interface may take time to load.
